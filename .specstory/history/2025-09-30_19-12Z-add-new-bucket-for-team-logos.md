<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>The user wants to add another R2 bucket to their wrangler.json configuration file. They want to add a bucket named "team-logos". 

Looking at the current configuration, they have one bucket in the `r2_buckets` array:
```json
"r2_buckets": [
  {
    "binding": "bucket",
    "bucket_name": "match-boxscores",
    "preview_bucket_name": "match-boxscores"
  }
]
```

They want to add another bucket named "team-logos". I should add it to this array. I'll need to give it a binding name as well. Since the first bucket has the binding "bucket", I could name this one something like "TEAM_LOGOS" or "teamLogos" or "teamLogosBucket". Looking at Cloudflare conventions, bindings are often in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for environment variables, but can also be camelCase. Let me use a sensible binding name like "TEAM_LOGOS".

I'll add this new bucket to the r2_buckets array.</details></think>

I'll add the new "team-logos" bucket to your wrangler.json configuration.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>Good! I've successfully added the new bucket to the r2_buckets array. The configuration now includes both buckets:
1. The existing "match-boxscores" bucket with binding "bucket"
2. The new "team-logos" bucket with binding "TEAM_LOGOS"

I used "TEAM_LOGOS" as the binding name to follow a common convention for environment variable naming, and it will be accessible in the worker code via `env.TEAM_LOGOS`.

The system reminder suggests I check for linter errors, but this is a JSON file and the changes look correct. I should confirm this is complete.</details></think>

Perfect! I've added the "team-logos" bucket to your wrangler.json configuration. The new bucket:
- Has the binding name `TEAM_LOGOS` (you can access it in your worker code via `env.TEAM_LOGOS`)
- Uses "team-logos" for both the bucket name and preview bucket name

Both buckets are now configured in your `r2_buckets` array.
